# [Problem A: Cracker Baking](https://nbhspc22.kattis.com/contests/nbhspc22/problems/nbhspc22.crackerbaking)

We are going to bake a number of tiny and square snack crackers (1â€‰cm on a side) in a square baking pan. Crackers may not overlap while baking, and must entirely fit within the baking pan.

Print the length (which is the same as the width), in centimetres, of the smallest baking pan that could be used. Baking pans have to be a whole number of centimetres in length and width.

## Input
The input is a positive integer N, the number of crackers. We have that N <= 1000.

## Output
Produce a positive integer, giving the length and width of the smallest possible baking pan.
